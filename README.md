This is a freeform mock cooking site project from The Odin Project with recipes called Odin Recipes!
This project demonstrates some of my skills in both HTML and CSS.

The project incorporates core HTML knowledge. Core HTML knowledge includes things like: basic "div" 
and "img" tags, "link" (for css) and "a" for site links, unordered and ordered lists, effective HTML 
file structure and using css to change layout and add visual styles.
