I will be creating an HTML website displaying recipes. This project will 
utilize core HTML skills such as using image tags, link tags, creating 
both ordered (numbered) and unordered (non-numbered) lists, creating 
an effective and well ordered HTML file structure and displaying my 
working knowledge of the basics of HTML coding. I will add more later as 
well once completed.
